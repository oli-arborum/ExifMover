ExifMover
=========

Just a small project to freshen up my Qt knowledge (and learn git)... :o)

Goal of this tiny project is to sort (i.e. move) JPEGs from my digicam from one directory into subdirectories of the format YYYY-MM-DD.

For now, libexif is used to read the creation timestamps from the JPEG files. This means ExifMover cannot be compiled under MS Windows or OS X without installed libexif.

Please also note I am using QtCreator for development of ExifMover.
Therefore the object files and binary output is currently put to ../ExifMover-build-desktop

This is my first time trying QtCreator (but not my first time to use Qt).
